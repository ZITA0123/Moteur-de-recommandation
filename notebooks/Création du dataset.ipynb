This film does not strive to be a particular good film, but it is enjoyable all the same. I watched it as a young adult, and the film was enjoyable and innocent. It's not a frightening film, but it's a film about friendship and understanding. It also had the humor element common in films for young adults. The other ghost characters provide this humor.This film is done well, and it is packed with action but also leaves room for the morales and patience in making friendships and learning how to understand different people or points of view.Young adults (aged 8-15) would probably enjoy this film more than any other audience.\",\n          \"I researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the Post WWII Greenwich Village world of gays and lesbians. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought this was ironic because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. It was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns, or alien monsters and I planned on being bored. But, I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground. As the glorious George Duning love theme soared, I suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love. The first stirrings of romantic/sexual love left me dazed as I left the theater. I am sure I'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by Kim Novak's startling, direct gaze. It's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump-start heterosexual puberty in so many of us. I am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as I watched that hat touch down fifty years later . . .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"helpful\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.columns"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"dLQMNUixoeEA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749143077692,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Gnekou Zita","userId":"05796276644095292764"}},"outputId":"377801b4-8d1d-4f37-ac89-6f6d1ed64da2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Index(['review_id', 'reviewer', 'movie', 'rating', 'review_summary',\n","       'review_date', 'spoiler_tag', 'review_detail', 'helpful'],\n","      dtype='object')"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Creation du champ review et label et équilibrage des données**"],"metadata":{"id":"8nfgqf1Jy0IK"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def null_values_summary(df, percent=0):\n","    total = df.isnull().sum()\n","    pct = (total / len(df)) * 100\n","    missing_data = pd.concat([total, pct], axis=1, keys=['Total', 'Percent'])\n","    filtered_data = missing_data[(missing_data['Total'] != 0) & (missing_data['Percent'] >= percent)]\n","    return filtered_data.sort_values('Total', ascending=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"P7MdrKVhq-8z"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def preprocess_dataframe(df):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Preprocesses the DataFrame by handling missing ratings, creating a 'review' column,\n","    converting rating to integer, and creating a 'label' column.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        df (pd.DataFrame): The input DataFrame.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        pd.DataFrame: The preprocessed DataFrame.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    #

Throughout the whole movie, I was puzzled and did not see any point to it. I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about. This movie is not worth watching at all. Not only is it sick and revolting but totally STUPID! Please don't watch unless you are one of those that likes to watch bad movies. If this movie questions Japanese society and their values and roles, than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know. This is a totally sick movie!!!!!!!! I did not enjoy it because it made no sense. My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under. It was total disappointment.\",\n          \"Let me be honest before expressing my thoughts publicly: Not only was I a big fan of \\\"The Runaways\\\", but I had the opportunity to meet Sandy West and Joan Jett and Kim Fowley on my first trek out to Los Angeles, California in the 80's and working with musicians who worked with ... each other. So my views many read a bit biased - but I am a fan first above all else.Let me point out what is very important to all who ever see this documentary - is that \\\"The Runaways\\\" were, are and always will be -the first female rock band that garnered attention and pricked up the music business ears that females can have a band, can ROCK and are well trained to do so.When the Go-Go's and The Bangles came out, I am sorry, I always saw them as second best and in the case of musicianship - very manufactured. The Runaways rocked and that was so important to open the doors to other female musicians that followed after them and did the same.This documentary gets into documenting 'The Runaways' and what they went through in five years. Although at times in the film I felt they held back on much that I remember happening to them at the time that they did not wish to get into, they went through enough to let you know. I am extremely proud of Vicki Blue (yeah, I know!)doing this project BEFORE others who may have more more money or other ambitions get hold of these ladies lives and do it. This is the keeper.The Runaways were SO ahead of their time. Each of them...and as a group. It is stated that \\\"someone has to be first\\\" and in doing so \\\"doesn't get the recognition they deserve\\\". I hope this documentary spurs new dialog and recognition about them. The Runaways are a triumph and a tragedy and this documentary gives you pause to think about each of it. And you should.These are a talented group of women who were brought together for a nice idea and got abused all the way. As a teen, you only want to do what is best...and for many of them it was the music. Here you learn just how much goes into this and what seeps in to push and break personalities, egos, mental health, family, residuals, sexual health, etc. in this entertainment industry.These ladies need to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame before anyone else (Hear me, Jan?!?!?!)that is the least that should be done. Next, this documentary should be nominated for an Academy Award. The RAW techniques in film documentaries are here, and it places a document of a time, a place and lives that HAS happened. Raw emotion, raw nerves and even the \\\"forgetting\\\" of memories. This is a clean documentary done in the \\\"old fashioned way\\\" -- as a documentary.A reunion tour? Well, that is quite clearly up to each of these ladies. It's their decision to do it...and WHAT they would do it for. Could be the greatest thing on earth...and then, could be a major faux pas in this day and time for promoters, et al. because of the past feelings, etc. It's all be up to them. But these women should be very smart by now and know whats coming before they get into it.Regardless, this documentary is the one to see and get an understanding. Bless them all.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"helpful\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 87884,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"A criminal mastermind of the 1930s Bonnie and Clyde is an important and engaging film marking the lives of a criminal couple. Historically, it was a controversial film for its portrayal of criminals as the hero and for the portrayal of violence. It has all of the elements of a great film, and it is certainly engaging.It's been a few years since I have seen this, but we watched it in a film history class, where we discussed life in the Great Depression, and Bonnie and Clyde apparently portrayed that well...as well as producing a controversial film. Unfortunately, this film seems to be a little bit overlooked now.\",\n          \"Awful! A joke! A mockery! What was good about this? May I remind you of a certain book by Jane Austin, this book was written well and was good for the genre it was aimed at. Highly popular. Well this film managed to cut half of what was in the book out of the film! The Book and award winning novel was wrecked by this travesty of a film. The worst film I have ever seen! No following of the plot, poor acting by most of the stars baring Judi Dench. No emotion, didn't make a big impression with it's target audience or any audience. Just pathetic. A waste of time and space. Rosumand Pike loved herself far too much, Keira Knightly gave a sickening performance and should never be allowed to act again and Donald Sutherland- well, no comment! Acting classes needed for the cast and the part everyone waited for was between Lizzie and Mr Darcy, but any emotion which could have been expressed was simply thrown out of the window when MacFayden and Knightly took the roles. They didn't display and emotion, they ruined a perfectly good novel and I cannot stress enough how dreadfully sickening this film was. Highly unreccomended. I give this a one- To improve the film- A new cast who can act well. (This would get it from a one to a four) If it hits it's targets and target audience. (four to a six) If the novel is portrayed in an entertainingly good light for it's genre and target audience. (six to an eight)The above would get it an 8 if all of it was achieved. It would get a 9 or a 10 if all the above was achieved and outstandingly done well in an amazing way.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

SIBELLE HU joins forces with MOON LEE to take revenge; both have lost the person closest to them, and the villain of the piece is FOK (the late EDDY KO is appropriately slimy and despicable). MOON LEE and YUKARI OSHIMA have been trained as assassins by their adoptive father FOK. The pre-credits sequence details their training at a very early age, and clearly differentiates the personalities of the two girls/women; the vicious nature of their foster brother and the ruthlessness of their mentor FOK.There is a lengthy section of the film that takes place in Thailand, where a would be boxer and his sister run foul of a cruel and manipulative promoter. Of course, the two female assassins are then assigned a mission in Thailand, where of course, the two very different pairs of siblings are fated to meet.There is the usual non-stop action, well choreographed but preposterous; the needless mayhem and senseless elimination of all the minor and some of the major characters; some interesting location shooting, and of course, the appeal of seeing the three women do their thing - something they do often and wellThough I was pleased that this film was broadcast locally on a Vancouver multi-cultural station, I am prone to dismiss this film as one that I would watch once, and no more.\",\n          \"It seems like the producers left this one in a bit of a mess... If you judged every director on only the one title, then your DVD shelf would be a very lonely place. Coppola, Spielberg, Stone, hell even Scorsese - they have all made slight 'miscalculations' throughout their respective careers. Keeping that in mind though, the last film that I saw from Gary Graver was the abysmal 'slasher' Trick or Treats, which in all honesty made Plan 9 from Outer Space look intellectual. Taking that into account I must admit that I didn't expect much from Moon in Scorpio. But with notorious exploitation titan Fred Olen Ray on board as co-producer, there's no way of ever knowing exactly what to expect. In all honesty the bizarre casting decision of putting Britt Eckland's name above the title was more than enough to get my initial curiosities aroused.Keeping things hackneyed, we begin with the oldest of all slasher clich\\u00e9s. Yep you guessed it; an unseen nut-nut makes a break from the least secure mental hospital imaginable, killing an unfortunate orderly on the way. Once outside the complex, the psycho makes short work of a cheery pharmaceutical salesman and then flees the scene in the dead guy's car. For some inexplicable reason, the head psychiatrist doesn't bother informing the Police that they have a murderous maniac on the loose. Instead he calls in Private Detective Richard Vargas who is described by one shrink as being, \\\"Almost crazy enough to be a patient here himself.\\\" Next we fast-forward two weeks and Vargas is seen boarding an abandoned-looking boat that is adrift in the middle of the sea. Once on board he finds Linda (Britt Eckland) sprawled across the floor in a heap. Whilst attempting to wake her up, she stabs him in the stomach with a bizarre spear like device. The (unconvincingly) hysterical Linda is then dragged off of the boat by two orderlies who don't seem at all concerned by the fact that Vargas has just been fatally impaled on the huge spike.A few days later, Linda is fit to be interviewed by the head psychiatrist and he asks her what exactly happened out in the middle of the sea. We soon learn that she had been on a honeymoon with her husband, two of his war buddies and their girlfriends. The plan was to sail too Acapulco and spend a couple of weeks lapping up the sun on the beaches. Unfortunately along with the suitcases and sangria, the gang had inadvertently brought along a maniacal killer who had his own reasons to want to be stranded in the ocean with the holidaymakers. For the rest of the runtime, we see through flashbacks exactly what happened aboard the cursed death ship. Just who was responsible for these viscous murders? According to many reports that I've read over the web, Moon in Scorpio was continually re-edited by the distributors and was eventually released without any of the supernatural elements that had been originally intended from the script. The IMDb mentions a vampire and astrological plot points, which sounds intriguing, but couldn't be further from the contents of the version that was eventually released direct to video. The only available VHS print is typical slasher by the numbers fare, and contains no trace of the rumored paranormal ingredients. Perhaps one day a Director's Cut DVD will solve the riddle of the missing plot points. Unfortunately whether you can blame the edit-happy distributors or not, Scorpio is a lackadaisical entry that lacks suspense, creativity and effort from any of the big name cast members. Eckland was laughable as she struggled to look even slightly motivated, whilst hard man character actor William Smith was totally wasted in an undemanding role.The film's structure is also totally inept. The flashback narration seems to run illogically beside what we are seeing on the screen and we are never given a credible conclusion as to the killer's motives. At a guess, I'd say that the maniac became a vampire post-death in the scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor. At one point in the runtime there's a slight hint as a character drinks her partner's blood after he accidentally cuts his finger whilst dicing carrots. There's also a sub-plot involving a link between the three male cast members, who fought in Vietnam together. But these few scenes, which amusingly look more like they were filmed in a park down the road from Gary Graver's house than anywhere near 'Nam, never amount to anything either. If you don't manage to work out the unseen killer's identity by the half hour mark then you shouldn't be watching anything that's not PG-13 rated. And the anemic showdown between the survivor and the killer couldn't have been any less entertaining if it were filmed in slow motion.Perhaps one day we will be able to see what Graver really intended with Moon in Scorpio. But as it stands I'm afraid that there is very little to recommend. Don't bother hunting this one down.\",\n          \"Saw II--Good, or bad? I don't know exactly how I felt about Saw II. The ending was a little bit confusing for me. Although I don't want to give away anything, the ending seemed to me like it didn't exactly fit together with the rest of the movie. Parts of it did, but there were also parts where I sat there thinking, \\\"What? There's no way in hell that could've happened.\\\" If you've seen Saw I, and if you're looking at this, I'm sure you have, you know that \\\"Jigsaw\\\" is the old man with cancer at the beginning of the movie. How does an elderly man that's dying pull all that off? It's not probable, but then again, I don't really think anyone could pull that off with absolutely no flaws.The 1st one was definitely a lot better, but what do you expect, right? With a movie like that, it's almost predictable that they will make a second one, but stupid at the same time, because you know by even looking at the previews that it's not going to be as good.Anddddd, judging by the ending of the second one, I'm almost sure that they're going to make a 3rd one. I'd recommend renting the 3rd and 2nd ones, because the second one is almost a waste of 9 dollars, and the 3rd one I can almost guarantee will be a waste.Saw II will keep you thinking though. Not that the 1st one didn't. But, hey, if you like that sort of thing, I'd recommend seeing it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"n\\u00e9gatif\",\n          \"positif\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data['labels'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":178},"id":"bZbI_OslGSuE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749154353552,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":30,"user":{"displayName":"Gnekou Zita","userId":"05796276644095292764"}},"outputId":"25eb07a1-66b7-42bb-ec32-35da533018d8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["labels\n","positif    25000\n","négatif    23297\n","Name: count, dtype: int64"],"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>count</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>labels</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>positif</th>\n","      <td>25000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>négatif</th>\n","      <td>23297</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> int64</label>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]}]}
