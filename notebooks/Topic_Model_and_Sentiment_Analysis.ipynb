SIBELLE HU joins forces with MOON LEE to take revenge; both have lost the person closest to them, and the villain of the piece is FOK (the late EDDY KO is appropriately slimy and despicable). MOON LEE and YUKARI OSHIMA have been trained as assassins by their adoptive father FOK. The pre-credits sequence details their training at a very early age, and clearly differentiates the personalities of the two girls/women; the vicious nature of their foster brother and the ruthlessness of their mentor FOK.There is a lengthy section of the film that takes place in Thailand, where a would be boxer and his sister run foul of a cruel and manipulative promoter. Of course, the two female assassins are then assigned a mission in Thailand, where of course, the two very different pairs of siblings are fated to meet.There is the usual non-stop action, well choreographed but preposterous; the needless mayhem and senseless elimination of all the minor and some of the major characters; some interesting location shooting, and of course, the appeal of seeing the three women do their thing - something they do often and wellThough I was pleased that this film was broadcast locally on a Vancouver multi-cultural station, I am prone to dismiss this film as one that I would watch once, and no more.\",\n          \"It seems like the producers left this one in a bit of a mess... If you judged every director on only the one title, then your DVD shelf would be a very lonely place. Coppola, Spielberg, Stone, hell even Scorsese - they have all made slight 'miscalculations' throughout their respective careers. Keeping that in mind though, the last film that I saw from Gary Graver was the abysmal 'slasher' Trick or Treats, which in all honesty made Plan 9 from Outer Space look intellectual. Taking that into account I must admit that I didn't expect much from Moon in Scorpio. But with notorious exploitation titan Fred Olen Ray on board as co-producer, there's no way of ever knowing exactly what to expect. In all honesty the bizarre casting decision of putting Britt Eckland's name above the title was more than enough to get my initial curiosities aroused.Keeping things hackneyed, we begin with the oldest of all slasher clich\\u00e9s. Yep you guessed it; an unseen nut-nut makes a break from the least secure mental hospital imaginable, killing an unfortunate orderly on the way. Once outside the complex, the psycho makes short work of a cheery pharmaceutical salesman and then flees the scene in the dead guy's car. For some inexplicable reason, the head psychiatrist doesn't bother informing the Police that they have a murderous maniac on the loose. Instead he calls in Private Detective Richard Vargas who is described by one shrink as being, \\\"Almost crazy enough to be a patient here himself.\\\" Next we fast-forward two weeks and Vargas is seen boarding an abandoned-looking boat that is adrift in the middle of the sea. Once on board he finds Linda (Britt Eckland) sprawled across the floor in a heap. Whilst attempting to wake her up, she stabs him in the stomach with a bizarre spear like device. The (unconvincingly) hysterical Linda is then dragged off of the boat by two orderlies who don't seem at all concerned by the fact that Vargas has just been fatally impaled on the huge spike.A few days later, Linda is fit to be interviewed by the head psychiatrist and he asks her what exactly happened out in the middle of the sea. We soon learn that she had been on a honeymoon with her husband, two of his war buddies and their girlfriends. The plan was to sail too Acapulco and spend a couple of weeks lapping up the sun on the beaches. Unfortunately along with the suitcases and sangria, the gang had inadvertently brought along a maniacal killer who had his own reasons to want to be stranded in the ocean with the holidaymakers. For the rest of the runtime, we see through flashbacks exactly what happened aboard the cursed death ship. Just who was responsible for these viscous murders? According to many reports that I've read over the web, Moon in Scorpio was continually re-edited by the distributors and was eventually released without any of the supernatural elements that had been originally intended from the script. The IMDb mentions a vampire and astrological plot points, which sounds intriguing, but couldn't be further from the contents of the version that was eventually released direct to video. The only available VHS print is typical slasher by the numbers fare, and contains no trace of the rumored paranormal ingredients. Perhaps one day a Director's Cut DVD will solve the riddle of the missing plot points. Unfortunately whether you can blame the edit-happy distributors or not, Scorpio is a lackadaisical entry that lacks suspense, creativity and effort from any of the big name cast members. Eckland was laughable as she struggled to look even slightly motivated, whilst hard man character actor William Smith was totally wasted in an undemanding role.The film's structure is also totally inept. The flashback narration seems to run illogically beside what we are seeing on the screen and we are never given a credible conclusion as to the killer's motives. At a guess, I'd say that the maniac became a vampire post-death in the scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor. At one point in the runtime there's a slight hint as a character drinks her partner's blood after he accidentally cuts his finger whilst dicing carrots. There's also a sub-plot involving a link between the three male cast members, who fought in Vietnam together. But these few scenes, which amusingly look more like they were filmed in a park down the road from Gary Graver's house than anywhere near 'Nam, never amount to anything either. If you don't manage to work out the unseen killer's identity by the half hour mark then you shouldn't be watching anything that's not PG-13 rated. And the anemic showdown between the survivor and the killer couldn't have been any less entertaining if it were filmed in slow motion.Perhaps one day we will be able to see what Graver really intended with Moon in Scorpio. But as it stands I'm afraid that there is very little to recommend. Don't bother hunting this one down.\",\n          \"Saw II--Good, or bad? I don't know exactly how I felt about Saw II. The ending was a little bit confusing for me. Although I don't want to give away anything, the ending seemed to me like it didn't exactly fit together with the rest of the movie. Parts of it did, but there were also parts where I sat there thinking, \\\"What? There's no way in hell that could've happened.\\\" If you've seen Saw I, and if you're looking at this, I'm sure you have, you know that \\\"Jigsaw\\\" is the old man with cancer at the beginning of the movie. How does an elderly man that's dying pull all that off? It's not probable, but then again, I don't really think anyone could pull that off with absolutely no flaws.The 1st one was definitely a lot better, but what do you expect, right? With a movie like that, it's almost predictable that they will make a second one, but stupid at the same time, because you know by even looking at the previews that it's not going to be as good.Anddddd, judging by the ending of the second one, I'm almost sure that they're going to make a 3rd one. I'd recommend renting the 3rd and 2nd ones, because the second one is almost a waste of 9 dollars, and the 3rd one I can almost guarantee will be a waste.Saw II will keep you thinking though. Not that the 1st one didn't.

SIBELLE HU joins forces with MOON LEE to take revenge; both have lost the person closest to them, and the villain of the piece is FOK (the late EDDY KO is appropriately slimy and despicable). MOON LEE and YUKARI OSHIMA have been trained as assassins by their adoptive father FOK. The pre-credits sequence details their training at a very early age, and clearly differentiates the personalities of the two girls/women; the vicious nature of their foster brother and the ruthlessness of their mentor FOK.There is a lengthy section of the film that takes place in Thailand, where a would be boxer and his sister run foul of a cruel and manipulative promoter. Of course, the two female assassins are then assigned a mission in Thailand, where of course, the two very different pairs of siblings are fated to meet.There is the usual non-stop action, well choreographed but preposterous; the needless mayhem and senseless elimination of all the minor and some of the major characters; some interesting location shooting, and of course, the appeal of seeing the three women do their thing - something they do often and wellThough I was pleased that this film was broadcast locally on a Vancouver multi-cultural station, I am prone to dismiss this film as one that I would watch once, and no more.\",\n          \"It seems like the producers left this one in a bit of a mess... If you judged every director on only the one title, then your DVD shelf would be a very lonely place. Coppola, Spielberg, Stone, hell even Scorsese - they have all made slight 'miscalculations' throughout their respective careers. Keeping that in mind though, the last film that I saw from Gary Graver was the abysmal 'slasher' Trick or Treats, which in all honesty made Plan 9 from Outer Space look intellectual. Taking that into account I must admit that I didn't expect much from Moon in Scorpio. But with notorious exploitation titan Fred Olen Ray on board as co-producer, there's no way of ever knowing exactly what to expect. In all honesty the bizarre casting decision of putting Britt Eckland's name above the title was more than enough to get my initial curiosities aroused.Keeping things hackneyed, we begin with the oldest of all slasher clich\\u00e9s. Yep you guessed it; an unseen nut-nut makes a break from the least secure mental hospital imaginable, killing an unfortunate orderly on the way. Once outside the complex, the psycho makes short work of a cheery pharmaceutical salesman and then flees the scene in the dead guy's car. For some inexplicable reason, the head psychiatrist doesn't bother informing the Police that they have a murderous maniac on the loose. Instead he calls in Private Detective Richard Vargas who is described by one shrink as being, \\\"Almost crazy enough to be a patient here himself.\\\" Next we fast-forward two weeks and Vargas is seen boarding an abandoned-looking boat that is adrift in the middle of the sea. Once on board he finds Linda (Britt Eckland) sprawled across the floor in a heap. Whilst attempting to wake her up, she stabs him in the stomach with a bizarre spear like device. The (unconvincingly) hysterical Linda is then dragged off of the boat by two orderlies who don't seem at all concerned by the fact that Vargas has just been fatally impaled on the huge spike.A few days later, Linda is fit to be interviewed by the head psychiatrist and he asks her what exactly happened out in the middle of the sea. We soon learn that she had been on a honeymoon with her husband, two of his war buddies and their girlfriends. The plan was to sail too Acapulco and spend a couple of weeks lapping up the sun on the beaches. Unfortunately along with the suitcases and sangria, the gang had inadvertently brought along a maniacal killer who had his own reasons to want to be stranded in the ocean with the holidaymakers. For the rest of the runtime, we see through flashbacks exactly what happened aboard the cursed death ship. Just who was responsible for these viscous murders? According to many reports that I've read over the web, Moon in Scorpio was continually re-edited by the distributors and was eventually released without any of the supernatural elements that had been originally intended from the script. The IMDb mentions a vampire and astrological plot points, which sounds intriguing, but couldn't be further from the contents of the version that was eventually released direct to video. The only available VHS print is typical slasher by the numbers fare, and contains no trace of the rumored paranormal ingredients. Perhaps one day a Director's Cut DVD will solve the riddle of the missing plot points. Unfortunately whether you can blame the edit-happy distributors or not, Scorpio is a lackadaisical entry that lacks suspense, creativity and effort from any of the big name cast members. Eckland was laughable as she struggled to look even slightly motivated, whilst hard man character actor William Smith was totally wasted in an undemanding role.The film's structure is also totally inept. The flashback narration seems to run illogically beside what we are seeing on the screen and we are never given a credible conclusion as to the killer's motives. At a guess, I'd say that the maniac became a vampire post-death in the scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor. At one point in the runtime there's a slight hint as a character drinks her partner's blood after he accidentally cuts his finger whilst dicing carrots. There's also a sub-plot involving a link between the three male cast members, who fought in Vietnam together. But these few scenes, which amusingly look more like they were filmed in a park down the road from Gary Graver's house than anywhere near 'Nam, never amount to anything either. If you don't manage to work out the unseen killer's identity by the half hour mark then you shouldn't be watching anything that's not PG-13 rated. And the anemic showdown between the survivor and the killer couldn't have been any less entertaining if it were filmed in slow motion.Perhaps one day we will be able to see what Graver really intended with Moon in Scorpio. But as it stands I'm afraid that there is very little to recommend. Don't bother hunting this one down.\",\n          \"Saw II--Good, or bad? I don't know exactly how I felt about Saw II. The ending was a little bit confusing for me. Although I don't want to give away anything, the ending seemed to me like it didn't exactly fit together with the rest of the movie. Parts of it did, but there were also parts where I sat there thinking, \\\"What? There's no way in hell that could've happened.\\\" If you've seen Saw I, and if you're looking at this, I'm sure you have, you know that \\\"Jigsaw\\\" is the old man with cancer at the beginning of the movie. How does an elderly man that's dying pull all that off? It's not probable, but then again, I don't really think anyone could pull that off with absolutely no flaws.The 1st one was definitely a lot better, but what do you expect, right? With a movie like that, it's almost predictable that they will make a second one, but stupid at the same time, because you know by even looking at the previews that it's not going to be as good.Anddddd, judging by the ending of the second one, I'm almost sure that they're going to make a 3rd one. I'd recommend renting the 3rd and 2nd ones, because the second one is almost a waste of 9 dollars, and the 3rd one I can almost guarantee will be a waste.Saw II will keep you thinking though. Not that the 1st one didn't. But, hey, if you like that sort of thing, I'd recommend seeing it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"n\\u00e9gatif\",\n          \"positif\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48282,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"great great popcorn movie watched video first released impressed acting spookily reminiscent marilyn mansons beautiful people video ghostly effects laughoutloud one liners stomach curdling horror combined make great movie experience meit fantastic score sets tone film geoffery rush superbly camp hammy millionaire rollercoaster park owner stephen price nod vincent 1959 original eerily spooky soundtrack especially characters first witness house fitting adds experience ive made quick review others already revealed bulk storylineand one say go rent dvd downside ending seems completely inconclusivebut wont reveal overallexcellent\",\n          \"great movie watched movie today mesmerised right away kevin bacon played retarded ricky well little girl showed much maturity one watch sure watch make sure tissues handthis film manages show beauty disability public perception retarded person one watch big time congratulations kevin bacon pulling convincingly one hell moviebacons portrayal disabled person amazing totally torn character think watch advise\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

SIBELLE HU joins forces with MOON LEE to take revenge; both have lost the person closest to them, and the villain of the piece is FOK (the late EDDY KO is appropriately slimy and despicable). MOON LEE and YUKARI OSHIMA have been trained as assassins by their adoptive father FOK. The pre-credits sequence details their training at a very early age, and clearly differentiates the personalities of the two girls/women; the vicious nature of their foster brother and the ruthlessness of their mentor FOK.There is a lengthy section of the film that takes place in Thailand, where a would be boxer and his sister run foul of a cruel and manipulative promoter. Of course, the two female assassins are then assigned a mission in Thailand, where of course, the two very different pairs of siblings are fated to meet.There is the usual non-stop action, well choreographed but preposterous; the needless mayhem and senseless elimination of all the minor and some of the major characters; some interesting location shooting, and of course, the appeal of seeing the three women do their thing - something they do often and wellThough I was pleased that this film was broadcast locally on a Vancouver multi-cultural station, I am prone to dismiss this film as one that I would watch once, and no more.\",\n          \"It seems like the producers left this one in a bit of a mess... If you judged every director on only the one title, then your DVD shelf would be a very lonely place. Coppola, Spielberg, Stone, hell even Scorsese - they have all made slight 'miscalculations' throughout their respective careers. Keeping that in mind though, the last film that I saw from Gary Graver was the abysmal 'slasher' Trick or Treats, which in all honesty made Plan 9 from Outer Space look intellectual. Taking that into account I must admit that I didn't expect much from Moon in Scorpio. But with notorious exploitation titan Fred Olen Ray on board as co-producer, there's no way of ever knowing exactly what to expect. In all honesty the bizarre casting decision of putting Britt Eckland's name above the title was more than enough to get my initial curiosities aroused.Keeping things hackneyed, we begin with the oldest of all slasher clich\\u00e9s. Yep you guessed it; an unseen nut-nut makes a break from the least secure mental hospital imaginable, killing an unfortunate orderly on the way. Once outside the complex, the psycho makes short work of a cheery pharmaceutical salesman and then flees the scene in the dead guy's car. For some inexplicable reason, the head psychiatrist doesn't bother informing the Police that they have a murderous maniac on the loose. Instead he calls in Private Detective Richard Vargas who is described by one shrink as being, \\\"Almost crazy enough to be a patient here himself.\\\" Next we fast-forward two weeks and Vargas is seen boarding an abandoned-looking boat that is adrift in the middle of the sea. Once on board he finds Linda (Britt Eckland) sprawled across the floor in a heap. Whilst attempting to wake her up, she stabs him in the stomach with a bizarre spear like device. The (unconvincingly) hysterical Linda is then dragged off of the boat by two orderlies who don't seem at all concerned by the fact that Vargas has just been fatally impaled on the huge spike.A few days later, Linda is fit to be interviewed by the head psychiatrist and he asks her what exactly happened out in the middle of the sea. We soon learn that she had been on a honeymoon with her husband, two of his war buddies and their girlfriends. The plan was to sail too Acapulco and spend a couple of weeks lapping up the sun on the beaches. Unfortunately along with the suitcases and sangria, the gang had inadvertently brought along a maniacal killer who had his own reasons to want to be stranded in the ocean with the holidaymakers. For the rest of the runtime, we see through flashbacks exactly what happened aboard the cursed death ship. Just who was responsible for these viscous murders? According to many reports that I've read over the web, Moon in Scorpio was continually re-edited by the distributors and was eventually released without any of the supernatural elements that had been originally intended from the script. The IMDb mentions a vampire and astrological plot points, which sounds intriguing, but couldn't be further from the contents of the version that was eventually released direct to video. The only available VHS print is typical slasher by the numbers fare, and contains no trace of the rumored paranormal ingredients. Perhaps one day a Director's Cut DVD will solve the riddle of the missing plot points. Unfortunately whether you can blame the edit-happy distributors or not, Scorpio is a lackadaisical entry that lacks suspense, creativity and effort from any of the big name cast members. Eckland was laughable as she struggled to look even slightly motivated, whilst hard man character actor William Smith was totally wasted in an undemanding role.The film's structure is also totally inept. The flashback narration seems to run illogically beside what we are seeing on the screen and we are never given a credible conclusion as to the killer's motives. At a guess, I'd say that the maniac became a vampire post-death in the scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor. At one point in the runtime there's a slight hint as a character drinks her partner's blood after he accidentally cuts his finger whilst dicing carrots. There's also a sub-plot involving a link between the three male cast members, who fought in Vietnam together. But these few scenes, which amusingly look more like they were filmed in a park down the road from Gary Graver's house than anywhere near 'Nam, never amount to anything either. If you don't manage to work out the unseen killer's identity by the half hour mark then you shouldn't be watching anything that's not PG-13 rated. And the anemic showdown between the survivor and the killer couldn't have been any less entertaining if it were filmed in slow motion.Perhaps one day we will be able to see what Graver really intended with Moon in Scorpio. But as it stands I'm afraid that there is very little to recommend. Don't bother hunting this one down.\",\n          \"Saw II--Good, or bad? I don't know exactly how I felt about Saw II. The ending was a little bit confusing for me. Although I don't want to give away anything, the ending seemed to me like it didn't exactly fit together with the rest of the movie. Parts of it did, but there were also parts where I sat there thinking, \\\"What? There's no way in hell that could've happened.\\\" If you've seen Saw I, and if you're looking at this, I'm sure you have, you know that \\\"Jigsaw\\\" is the old man with cancer at the beginning of the movie. How does an elderly man that's dying pull all that off? It's not probable, but then again, I don't really think anyone could pull that off with absolutely no flaws.The 1st one was definitely a lot better, but what do you expect, right? With a movie like that, it's almost predictable that they will make a second one, but stupid at the same time, because you know by even looking at the previews that it's not going to be as good.Anddddd, judging by the ending of the second one, I'm almost sure that they're going to make a 3rd one. I'd recommend renting the 3rd and 2nd ones, because the second one is almost a waste of 9 dollars, and the 3rd one I can almost guarantee will be a waste.Saw II will keep you thinking though. Not that the 1st one didn't. But, hey, if you like that sort of thing, I'd recommend seeing it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"n\\u00e9gatif\",\n          \"positif\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48282,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"great great popcorn movie watched video first released impressed acting spookily reminiscent marilyn mansons beautiful people video ghostly effects laughoutloud one liners stomach curdling horror combined make great movie experience meit fantastic score sets tone film geoffery rush superbly camp hammy millionaire rollercoaster park owner stephen price nod vincent 1959 original eerily spooky soundtrack especially characters first witness house fitting adds experience ive made quick review others already revealed bulk storylineand one say go rent dvd downside ending seems completely inconclusivebut wont reveal overallexcellent\",\n          \"great movie watched movie today mesmerised right away kevin bacon played retarded ricky well little girl showed much maturity one watch sure watch make sure tissues handthis film manages show beauty disability public perception retarded person one watch big time congratulations kevin bacon pulling convincingly one hell moviebacons portrayal disabled person amazing totally torn character think watch advise\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 8,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

SIBELLE HU joins forces with MOON LEE to take revenge; both have lost the person closest to them, and the villain of the piece is FOK (the late EDDY KO is appropriately slimy and despicable). MOON LEE and YUKARI OSHIMA have been trained as assassins by their adoptive father FOK. The pre-credits sequence details their training at a very early age, and clearly differentiates the personalities of the two girls/women; the vicious nature of their foster brother and the ruthlessness of their mentor FOK.There is a lengthy section of the film that takes place in Thailand, where a would be boxer and his sister run foul of a cruel and manipulative promoter. Of course, the two female assassins are then assigned a mission in Thailand, where of course, the two very different pairs of siblings are fated to meet.There is the usual non-stop action, well choreographed but preposterous; the needless mayhem and senseless elimination of all the minor and some of the major characters; some interesting location shooting, and of course, the appeal of seeing the three women do their thing - something they do often and wellThough I was pleased that this film was broadcast locally on a Vancouver multi-cultural station, I am prone to dismiss this film as one that I would watch once, and no more.\",\n          \"It seems like the producers left this one in a bit of a mess... If you judged every director on only the one title, then your DVD shelf would be a very lonely place. Coppola, Spielberg, Stone, hell even Scorsese - they have all made slight 'miscalculations' throughout their respective careers. Keeping that in mind though, the last film that I saw from Gary Graver was the abysmal 'slasher' Trick or Treats, which in all honesty made Plan 9 from Outer Space look intellectual. Taking that into account I must admit that I didn't expect much from Moon in Scorpio. But with notorious exploitation titan Fred Olen Ray on board as co-producer, there's no way of ever knowing exactly what to expect. In all honesty the bizarre casting decision of putting Britt Eckland's name above the title was more than enough to get my initial curiosities aroused.Keeping things hackneyed, we begin with the oldest of all slasher clich\\u00e9s. Yep you guessed it; an unseen nut-nut makes a break from the least secure mental hospital imaginable, killing an unfortunate orderly on the way. Once outside the complex, the psycho makes short work of a cheery pharmaceutical salesman and then flees the scene in the dead guy's car. For some inexplicable reason, the head psychiatrist doesn't bother informing the Police that they have a murderous maniac on the loose. Instead he calls in Private Detective Richard Vargas who is described by one shrink as being, \\\"Almost crazy enough to be a patient here himself.\\\" Next we fast-forward two weeks and Vargas is seen boarding an abandoned-looking boat that is adrift in the middle of the sea. Once on board he finds Linda (Britt Eckland) sprawled across the floor in a heap. Whilst attempting to wake her up, she stabs him in the stomach with a bizarre spear like device. The (unconvincingly) hysterical Linda is then dragged off of the boat by two orderlies who don't seem at all concerned by the fact that Vargas has just been fatally impaled on the huge spike.A few days later, Linda is fit to be interviewed by the head psychiatrist and he asks her what exactly happened out in the middle of the sea. We soon learn that she had been on a honeymoon with her husband, two of his war buddies and their girlfriends. The plan was to sail too Acapulco and spend a couple of weeks lapping up the sun on the beaches. Unfortunately along with the suitcases and sangria, the gang had inadvertently brought along a maniacal killer who had his own reasons to want to be stranded in the ocean with the holidaymakers. For the rest of the runtime, we see through flashbacks exactly what happened aboard the cursed death ship. Just who was responsible for these viscous murders? According to many reports that I've read over the web, Moon in Scorpio was continually re-edited by the distributors and was eventually released without any of the supernatural elements that had been originally intended from the script. The IMDb mentions a vampire and astrological plot points, which sounds intriguing, but couldn't be further from the contents of the version that was eventually released direct to video. The only available VHS print is typical slasher by the numbers fare, and contains no trace of the rumored paranormal ingredients. Perhaps one day a Director's Cut DVD will solve the riddle of the missing plot points. Unfortunately whether you can blame the edit-happy distributors or not, Scorpio is a lackadaisical entry that lacks suspense, creativity and effort from any of the big name cast members. Eckland was laughable as she struggled to look even slightly motivated, whilst hard man character actor William Smith was totally wasted in an undemanding role.The film's structure is also totally inept. The flashback narration seems to run illogically beside what we are seeing on the screen and we are never given a credible conclusion as to the killer's motives. At a guess, I'd say that the maniac became a vampire post-death in the scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor. At one point in the runtime there's a slight hint as a character drinks her partner's blood after he accidentally cuts his finger whilst dicing carrots. There's also a sub-plot involving a link between the three male cast members, who fought in Vietnam together. But these few scenes, which amusingly look more like they were filmed in a park down the road from Gary Graver's house than anywhere near 'Nam, never amount to anything either. If you don't manage to work out the unseen killer's identity by the half hour mark then you shouldn't be watching anything that's not PG-13 rated. And the anemic showdown between the survivor and the killer couldn't have been any less entertaining if it were filmed in slow motion.Perhaps one day we will be able to see what Graver really intended with Moon in Scorpio. But as it stands I'm afraid that there is very little to recommend. Don't bother hunting this one down.\",\n          \"Saw II--Good, or bad? I don't know exactly how I felt about Saw II. The ending was a little bit confusing for me. Although I don't want to give away anything, the ending seemed to me like it didn't exactly fit together with the rest of the movie. Parts of it did, but there were also parts where I sat there thinking, \\\"What? There's no way in hell that could've happened.\\\" If you've seen Saw I, and if you're looking at this, I'm sure you have, you know that \\\"Jigsaw\\\" is the old man with cancer at the beginning of the movie. How does an elderly man that's dying pull all that off? It's not probable, but then again, I don't really think anyone could pull that off with absolutely no flaws.The 1st one was definitely a lot better, but what do you expect, right? With a movie like that, it's almost predictable that they will make a second one, but stupid at the same time, because you know by even looking at the previews that it's not going to be as good.Anddddd, judging by the ending of the second one, I'm almost sure that they're going to make a 3rd one. I'd recommend renting the 3rd and 2nd ones, because the second one is almost a waste of 9 dollars, and the 3rd one I can almost guarantee will be a waste.Saw II will keep you thinking though. Not that the 1st one didn't. But, hey, if you like that sort of thing, I'd recommend seeing it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"n\\u00e9gatif\",\n          \"positif\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48282,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"great great popcorn movie watched video first released impressed acting spookily reminiscent marilyn mansons beautiful people video ghostly effects laughoutloud one liners stomach curdling horror combined make great movie experience meit fantastic score sets tone film geoffery rush superbly camp hammy millionaire rollercoaster park owner stephen price nod vincent 1959 original eerily spooky soundtrack especially characters first witness house fitting adds experience ive made quick review others already revealed bulk storylineand one say go rent dvd downside ending seems completely inconclusivebut wont reveal overallexcellent\",\n          \"great movie watched movie today mesmerised right away kevin bacon played retarded ricky well little girl showed much maturity one watch sure watch make sure tissues handthis film manages show beauty disability public perception retarded person one watch big time congratulations kevin bacon pulling convincingly one hell moviebacons portrayal disabled person amazing totally torn character think watch advise\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 8,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"theme\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Fast Food and Health\",\n          \"General Cinema\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

SIBELLE HU joins forces with MOON LEE to take revenge; both have lost the person closest to them, and the villain of the piece is FOK (the late EDDY KO is appropriately slimy and despicable). MOON LEE and YUKARI OSHIMA have been trained as assassins by their adoptive father FOK. The pre-credits sequence details their training at a very early age, and clearly differentiates the personalities of the two girls/women; the vicious nature of their foster brother and the ruthlessness of their mentor FOK.There is a lengthy section of the film that takes place in Thailand, where a would be boxer and his sister run foul of a cruel and manipulative promoter. Of course, the two female assassins are then assigned a mission in Thailand, where of course, the two very different pairs of siblings are fated to meet.There is the usual non-stop action, well choreographed but preposterous; the needless mayhem and senseless elimination of all the minor and some of the major characters; some interesting location shooting, and of course, the appeal of seeing the three women do their thing - something they do often and wellThough I was pleased that this film was broadcast locally on a Vancouver multi-cultural station, I am prone to dismiss this film as one that I would watch once, and no more.\",\n          \"It seems like the producers left this one in a bit of a mess... If you judged every director on only the one title, then your DVD shelf would be a very lonely place. Coppola, Spielberg, Stone, hell even Scorsese - they have all made slight 'miscalculations' throughout their respective careers. Keeping that in mind though, the last film that I saw from Gary Graver was the abysmal 'slasher' Trick or Treats, which in all honesty made Plan 9 from Outer Space look intellectual. Taking that into account I must admit that I didn't expect much from Moon in Scorpio. But with notorious exploitation titan Fred Olen Ray on board as co-producer, there's no way of ever knowing exactly what to expect. In all honesty the bizarre casting decision of putting Britt Eckland's name above the title was more than enough to get my initial curiosities aroused.Keeping things hackneyed, we begin with the oldest of all slasher clich\\u00e9s. Yep you guessed it; an unseen nut-nut makes a break from the least secure mental hospital imaginable, killing an unfortunate orderly on the way. Once outside the complex, the psycho makes short work of a cheery pharmaceutical salesman and then flees the scene in the dead guy's car. For some inexplicable reason, the head psychiatrist doesn't bother informing the Police that they have a murderous maniac on the loose. Instead he calls in Private Detective Richard Vargas who is described by one shrink as being, \\\"Almost crazy enough to be a patient here himself.\\\" Next we fast-forward two weeks and Vargas is seen boarding an abandoned-looking boat that is adrift in the middle of the sea. Once on board he finds Linda (Britt Eckland) sprawled across the floor in a heap. Whilst attempting to wake her up, she stabs him in the stomach with a bizarre spear like device. The (unconvincingly) hysterical Linda is then dragged off of the boat by two orderlies who don't seem at all concerned by the fact that Vargas has just been fatally impaled on the huge spike.A few days later, Linda is fit to be interviewed by the head psychiatrist and he asks her what exactly happened out in the middle of the sea. We soon learn that she had been on a honeymoon with her husband, two of his war buddies and their girlfriends. The plan was to sail too Acapulco and spend a couple of weeks lapping up the sun on the beaches. Unfortunately along with the suitcases and sangria, the gang had inadvertently brought along a maniacal killer who had his own reasons to want to be stranded in the ocean with the holidaymakers. For the rest of the runtime, we see through flashbacks exactly what happened aboard the cursed death ship. Just who was responsible for these viscous murders? According to many reports that I've read over the web, Moon in Scorpio was continually re-edited by the distributors and was eventually released without any of the supernatural elements that had been originally intended from the script. The IMDb mentions a vampire and astrological plot points, which sounds intriguing, but couldn't be further from the contents of the version that was eventually released direct to video. The only available VHS print is typical slasher by the numbers fare, and contains no trace of the rumored paranormal ingredients. Perhaps one day a Director's Cut DVD will solve the riddle of the missing plot points. Unfortunately whether you can blame the edit-happy distributors or not, Scorpio is a lackadaisical entry that lacks suspense, creativity and effort from any of the big name cast members. Eckland was laughable as she struggled to look even slightly motivated, whilst hard man character actor William Smith was totally wasted in an undemanding role.The film's structure is also totally inept. The flashback narration seems to run illogically beside what we are seeing on the screen and we are never given a credible conclusion as to the killer's motives. At a guess, I'd say that the maniac became a vampire post-death in the scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor. At one point in the runtime there's a slight hint as a character drinks her partner's blood after he accidentally cuts his finger whilst dicing carrots. There's also a sub-plot involving a link between the three male cast members, who fought in Vietnam together. But these few scenes, which amusingly look more like they were filmed in a park down the road from Gary Graver's house than anywhere near 'Nam, never amount to anything either. If you don't manage to work out the unseen killer's identity by the half hour mark then you shouldn't be watching anything that's not PG-13 rated. And the anemic showdown between the survivor and the killer couldn't have been any less entertaining if it were filmed in slow motion.Perhaps one day we will be able to see what Graver really intended with Moon in Scorpio. But as it stands I'm afraid that there is very little to recommend. Don't bother hunting this one down.\",\n          \"Saw II--Good, or bad? I don't know exactly how I felt about Saw II. The ending was a little bit confusing for me. Although I don't want to give away anything, the ending seemed to me like it didn't exactly fit together with the rest of the movie. Parts of it did, but there were also parts where I sat there thinking, \\\"What? There's no way in hell that could've happened.\\\" If you've seen Saw I, and if you're looking at this, I'm sure you have, you know that \\\"Jigsaw\\\" is the old man with cancer at the beginning of the movie. How does an elderly man that's dying pull all that off? It's not probable, but then again, I don't really think anyone could pull that off with absolutely no flaws.The 1st one was definitely a lot better, but what do you expect, right? With a movie like that, it's almost predictable that they will make a second one, but stupid at the same time, because you know by even looking at the previews that it's not going to be as good.Anddddd, judging by the ending of the second one, I'm almost sure that they're going to make a 3rd one. I'd recommend renting the 3rd and 2nd ones, because the second one is almost a waste of 9 dollars, and the 3rd one I can almost guarantee will be a waste.Saw II will keep you thinking though. Not that the 1st one didn't. But, hey, if you like that sort of thing, I'd recommend seeing it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"n\\u00e9gatif\",\n          \"positif\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48282,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"great great popcorn movie watched video first released impressed acting spookily reminiscent marilyn mansons beautiful people video ghostly effects laughoutloud one liners stomach curdling horror combined make great movie experience meit fantastic score sets tone film geoffery rush superbly camp hammy millionaire rollercoaster park owner stephen price nod vincent 1959 original eerily spooky soundtrack especially characters first witness house fitting adds experience ive made quick review others already revealed bulk storylineand one say go rent dvd downside ending seems completely inconclusivebut wont reveal overallexcellent\",\n          \"great movie watched movie today mesmerised right away kevin bacon played retarded ricky well little girl showed much maturity one watch sure watch make sure tissues handthis film manages show beauty disability public perception retarded person one watch big time congratulations kevin bacon pulling convincingly one hell moviebacons portrayal disabled person amazing totally torn character think watch advise\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 8,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"theme\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Fast Food and Health\",\n          \"General Cinema\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"emotion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"joy\",\n          \"fear\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

SIBELLE HU joins forces with MOON LEE to take revenge; both have lost the person closest to them, and the villain of the piece is FOK (the late EDDY KO is appropriately slimy and despicable). MOON LEE and YUKARI OSHIMA have been trained as assassins by their adoptive father FOK. The pre-credits sequence details their training at a very early age, and clearly differentiates the personalities of the two girls/women; the vicious nature of their foster brother and the ruthlessness of their mentor FOK.There is a lengthy section of the film that takes place in Thailand, where a would be boxer and his sister run foul of a cruel and manipulative promoter. Of course, the two female assassins are then assigned a mission in Thailand, where of course, the two very different pairs of siblings are fated to meet.There is the usual non-stop action, well choreographed but preposterous; the needless mayhem and senseless elimination of all the minor and some of the major characters; some interesting location shooting, and of course, the appeal of seeing the three women do their thing - something they do often and wellThough I was pleased that this film was broadcast locally on a Vancouver multi-cultural station, I am prone to dismiss this film as one that I would watch once, and no more.\",\n          \"It seems like the producers left this one in a bit of a mess... If you judged every director on only the one title, then your DVD shelf would be a very lonely place. Coppola, Spielberg, Stone, hell even Scorsese - they have all made slight 'miscalculations' throughout their respective careers. Keeping that in mind though, the last film that I saw from Gary Graver was the abysmal 'slasher' Trick or Treats, which in all honesty made Plan 9 from Outer Space look intellectual. Taking that into account I must admit that I didn't expect much from Moon in Scorpio. But with notorious exploitation titan Fred Olen Ray on board as co-producer, there's no way of ever knowing exactly what to expect. In all honesty the bizarre casting decision of putting Britt Eckland's name above the title was more than enough to get my initial curiosities aroused.Keeping things hackneyed, we begin with the oldest of all slasher clich\\u00e9s. Yep you guessed it; an unseen nut-nut makes a break from the least secure mental hospital imaginable, killing an unfortunate orderly on the way. Once outside the complex, the psycho makes short work of a cheery pharmaceutical salesman and then flees the scene in the dead guy's car. For some inexplicable reason, the head psychiatrist doesn't bother informing the Police that they have a murderous maniac on the loose. Instead he calls in Private Detective Richard Vargas who is described by one shrink as being, \\\"Almost crazy enough to be a patient here himself.\\\" Next we fast-forward two weeks and Vargas is seen boarding an abandoned-looking boat that is adrift in the middle of the sea. Once on board he finds Linda (Britt Eckland) sprawled across the floor in a heap. Whilst attempting to wake her up, she stabs him in the stomach with a bizarre spear like device. The (unconvincingly) hysterical Linda is then dragged off of the boat by two orderlies who don't seem at all concerned by the fact that Vargas has just been fatally impaled on the huge spike.A few days later, Linda is fit to be interviewed by the head psychiatrist and he asks her what exactly happened out in the middle of the sea. We soon learn that she had been on a honeymoon with her husband, two of his war buddies and their girlfriends. The plan was to sail too Acapulco and spend a couple of weeks lapping up the sun on the beaches. Unfortunately along with the suitcases and sangria, the gang had inadvertently brought along a maniacal killer who had his own reasons to want to be stranded in the ocean with the holidaymakers. For the rest of the runtime, we see through flashbacks exactly what happened aboard the cursed death ship. Just who was responsible for these viscous murders? According to many reports that I've read over the web, Moon in Scorpio was continually re-edited by the distributors and was eventually released without any of the supernatural elements that had been originally intended from the script. The IMDb mentions a vampire and astrological plot points, which sounds intriguing, but couldn't be further from the contents of the version that was eventually released direct to video. The only available VHS print is typical slasher by the numbers fare, and contains no trace of the rumored paranormal ingredients. Perhaps one day a Director's Cut DVD will solve the riddle of the missing plot points. Unfortunately whether you can blame the edit-happy distributors or not, Scorpio is a lackadaisical entry that lacks suspense, creativity and effort from any of the big name cast members. Eckland was laughable as she struggled to look even slightly motivated, whilst hard man character actor William Smith was totally wasted in an undemanding role.The film's structure is also totally inept. The flashback narration seems to run illogically beside what we are seeing on the screen and we are never given a credible conclusion as to the killer's motives. At a guess, I'd say that the maniac became a vampire post-death in the scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor. At one point in the runtime there's a slight hint as a character drinks her partner's blood after he accidentally cuts his finger whilst dicing carrots. There's also a sub-plot involving a link between the three male cast members, who fought in Vietnam together. But these few scenes, which amusingly look more like they were filmed in a park down the road from Gary Graver's house than anywhere near 'Nam, never amount to anything either. If you don't manage to work out the unseen killer's identity by the half hour mark then you shouldn't be watching anything that's not PG-13 rated. And the anemic showdown between the survivor and the killer couldn't have been any less entertaining if it were filmed in slow motion.Perhaps one day we will be able to see what Graver really intended with Moon in Scorpio. But as it stands I'm afraid that there is very little to recommend. Don't bother hunting this one down.\",\n          \"Saw II--Good, or bad? I don't know exactly how I felt about Saw II. The ending was a little bit confusing for me. Although I don't want to give away anything, the ending seemed to me like it didn't exactly fit together with the rest of the movie. Parts of it did, but there were also parts where I sat there thinking, \\\"What? There's no way in hell that could've happened.\\\" If you've seen Saw I, and if you're looking at this, I'm sure you have, you know that \\\"Jigsaw\\\" is the old man with cancer at the beginning of the movie. How does an elderly man that's dying pull all that off? It's not probable, but then again, I don't really think anyone could pull that off with absolutely no flaws.The 1st one was definitely a lot better, but what do you expect, right? With a movie like that, it's almost predictable that they will make a second one, but stupid at the same time, because you know by even looking at the previews that it's not going to be as good.Anddddd, judging by the ending of the second one, I'm almost sure that they're going to make a 3rd one. I'd recommend renting the 3rd and 2nd ones, because the second one is almost a waste of 9 dollars, and the 3rd one I can almost guarantee will be a waste.Saw II will keep you thinking though. Not that the 1st one didn't. But, hey, if you like that sort of thing, I'd recommend seeing it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"n\\u00e9gatif\",\n          \"positif\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"theme\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Fast Food and Health\",\n          \"General Cinema\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"emotion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"joy\",\n          \"fear\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

SIBELLE HU joins forces with MOON LEE to take revenge; both have lost the person closest to them, and the villain of the piece is FOK (the late EDDY KO is appropriately slimy and despicable). MOON LEE and YUKARI OSHIMA have been trained as assassins by their adoptive father FOK. The pre-credits sequence details their training at a very early age, and clearly differentiates the personalities of the two girls/women; the vicious nature of their foster brother and the ruthlessness of their mentor FOK.There is a lengthy section of the film that takes place in Thailand, where a would be boxer and his sister run foul of a cruel and manipulative promoter. Of course, the two female assassins are then assigned a mission in Thailand, where of course, the two very different pairs of siblings are fated to meet.There is the usual non-stop action, well choreographed but preposterous; the needless mayhem and senseless elimination of all the minor and some of the major characters; some interesting location shooting, and of course, the appeal of seeing the three women do their thing - something they do often and wellThough I was pleased that this film was broadcast locally on a Vancouver multi-cultural station, I am prone to dismiss this film as one that I would watch once, and no more.\",\n          \"It seems like the producers left this one in a bit of a mess... If you judged every director on only the one title, then your DVD shelf would be a very lonely place. Coppola, Spielberg, Stone, hell even Scorsese - they have all made slight 'miscalculations' throughout their respective careers. Keeping that in mind though, the last film that I saw from Gary Graver was the abysmal 'slasher' Trick or Treats, which in all honesty made Plan 9 from Outer Space look intellectual. Taking that into account I must admit that I didn't expect much from Moon in Scorpio. But with notorious exploitation titan Fred Olen Ray on board as co-producer, there's no way of ever knowing exactly what to expect. In all honesty the bizarre casting decision of putting Britt Eckland's name above the title was more than enough to get my initial curiosities aroused.Keeping things hackneyed, we begin with the oldest of all slasher clich\\u00e9s. Yep you guessed it; an unseen nut-nut makes a break from the least secure mental hospital imaginable, killing an unfortunate orderly on the way. Once outside the complex, the psycho makes short work of a cheery pharmaceutical salesman and then flees the scene in the dead guy's car. For some inexplicable reason, the head psychiatrist doesn't bother informing the Police that they have a murderous maniac on the loose. Instead he calls in Private Detective Richard Vargas who is described by one shrink as being, \\\"Almost crazy enough to be a patient here himself.\\\" Next we fast-forward two weeks and Vargas is seen boarding an abandoned-looking boat that is adrift in the middle of the sea. Once on board he finds Linda (Britt Eckland) sprawled across the floor in a heap. Whilst attempting to wake her up, she stabs him in the stomach with a bizarre spear like device. The (unconvincingly) hysterical Linda is then dragged off of the boat by two orderlies who don't seem at all concerned by the fact that Vargas has just been fatally impaled on the huge spike.A few days later, Linda is fit to be interviewed by the head psychiatrist and he asks her what exactly happened out in the middle of the sea. We soon learn that she had been on a honeymoon with her husband, two of his war buddies and their girlfriends. The plan was to sail too Acapulco and spend a couple of weeks lapping up the sun on the beaches. Unfortunately along with the suitcases and sangria, the gang had inadvertently brought along a maniacal killer who had his own reasons to want to be stranded in the ocean with the holidaymakers. For the rest of the runtime, we see through flashbacks exactly what happened aboard the cursed death ship. Just who was responsible for these viscous murders? According to many reports that I've read over the web, Moon in Scorpio was continually re-edited by the distributors and was eventually released without any of the supernatural elements that had been originally intended from the script. The IMDb mentions a vampire and astrological plot points, which sounds intriguing, but couldn't be further from the contents of the version that was eventually released direct to video. The only available VHS print is typical slasher by the numbers fare, and contains no trace of the rumored paranormal ingredients. Perhaps one day a Director's Cut DVD will solve the riddle of the missing plot points. Unfortunately whether you can blame the edit-happy distributors or not, Scorpio is a lackadaisical entry that lacks suspense, creativity and effort from any of the big name cast members. Eckland was laughable as she struggled to look even slightly motivated, whilst hard man character actor William Smith was totally wasted in an undemanding role.The film's structure is also totally inept. The flashback narration seems to run illogically beside what we are seeing on the screen and we are never given a credible conclusion as to the killer's motives. At a guess, I'd say that the maniac became a vampire post-death in the scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor. At one point in the runtime there's a slight hint as a character drinks her partner's blood after he accidentally cuts his finger whilst dicing carrots. There's also a sub-plot involving a link between the three male cast members, who fought in Vietnam together. But these few scenes, which amusingly look more like they were filmed in a park down the road from Gary Graver's house than anywhere near 'Nam, never amount to anything either. If you don't manage to work out the unseen killer's identity by the half hour mark then you shouldn't be watching anything that's not PG-13 rated. And the anemic showdown between the survivor and the killer couldn't have been any less entertaining if it were filmed in slow motion.Perhaps one day we will be able to see what Graver really intended with Moon in Scorpio. But as it stands I'm afraid that there is very little to recommend. Don't bother hunting this one down.\",\n          \"Saw II--Good, or bad? I don't know exactly how I felt about Saw II. The ending was a little bit confusing for me. Although I don't want to give away anything, the ending seemed to me like it didn't exactly fit together with the rest of the movie. Parts of it did, but there were also parts where I sat there thinking, \\\"What? There's no way in hell that could've happened.\\\" If you've seen Saw I, and if you're looking at this, I'm sure you have, you know that \\\"Jigsaw\\\" is the old man with cancer at the beginning of the movie. How does an elderly man that's dying pull all that off? It's not probable, but then again, I don't really think anyone could pull that off with absolutely no flaws.The 1st one was definitely a lot better, but what do you expect, right? With a movie like that, it's almost predictable that they will make a second one, but stupid at the same time, because you know by even looking at the previews that it's not going to be as good.Anddddd, judging by the ending of the second one, I'm almost sure that they're going to make a 3rd one. I'd recommend renting the 3rd and 2nd ones, because the second one is almost a waste of 9 dollars, and the 3rd one I can almost guarantee will be a waste.Saw II will keep you thinking though. Not that the 1st one didn't. But, hey, if you like that sort of thing, I'd recommend seeing it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"n\\u00e9gatif\",\n          \"positif\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"theme\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Fast Food and Health\",\n          \"General Cinema\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"emotion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"joy\",\n          \"fear\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
